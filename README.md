# OpenMW Collada exporter for Blender

OpenMW Collada exporter for [Blender](https://www.blender.org), making the
format viable for importing meshes into [OpenMW](https://openmw.org)
using a libre format.

This is a fork of the [Better Collada Exporter](https://github.com/godotengine/collada-exporter)
adjusted to support the specifics of Blender to OpenMW asset pipeline.

## Installation

   scripts/addons folder on your system (you should see other io_scene_*
   folders there from other addons). Copy the entire dir and not just its
   contents.
2. Go to the Blender settings and enable the "OpenMW Exporter" plugin.
3. Enjoy full-featured Collada export.
